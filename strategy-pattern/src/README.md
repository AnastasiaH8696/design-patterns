You should define the Country class.

It should include (at the minimum) the following instance variable:
* population
* area
* gdp

Develop a small application that creates a list of 5 Country objects.

Each one of them represents a specific country. 

You should implement the strategy design pattern by implementing Comparator in multiple different classes, in order to allow us to sort the countries according to their area, gdp and population.
