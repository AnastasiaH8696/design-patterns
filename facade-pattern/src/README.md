The information system you work on has the multiple classes. Each class has static methods that allow you to perform various operations.

The MathUtils class has the following methods:
```
public static double total(double num1, double num2)
public static double multiply(double num1, double num2)
```

The FinanceUtils has the following method:
```
public static double calculateVAT(double price)
```

The BankUtils has the following methods:
```
public static double convertFromShekelsToDollar(double shekels)
```
You should implement the Facade design pattern in order to get one class that provides us with all utilities.
