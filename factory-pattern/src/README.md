You should define the following classes: 
* SimplePlasticDrone
* DroneWithMissiles
* KamikazaDrone

You should define the DronesFactory class.

DronesFactory should include the definition of createDrone method.

Calling the createDrone method we should pass over one of the following strings:
* "simple"
* "missiles"
* "kamikaza"

The createDrone method will return a reference for a new object, instantiated from SimplePlasticDrone, MissilesDrone or KamikazaDrone (accordingly).

Your code should implement the Factory Method design pattern.
